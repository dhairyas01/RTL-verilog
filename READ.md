# RTL Verilog Repository

Welcome to the RTL Verilog repository! This repository contains RTL (Register Transfer Level) designs implemented in Verilog.

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of RTL designs written in Verilog. RTL is a level of abstraction used in digital circuit design, where the behavior of the digital circuits is defined in terms of registers, logic gates, and the flow of data between them.

## Contents

- **Designs**: This directory contains various RTL designs implemented in Verilog. Each design is contained within its own subdirectory along with relevant documentation and testbenches.

- **Testbenches**: Testbenches are provided alongside the RTL designs to facilitate simulation and verification. These testbenches are written in Verilog and are used to verify the functionality and correctness of the RTL designs.

## Usage

To use the RTL designs in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired design directory:

    ```
    cd RTL_verilog/<design_name>
    ```

3. Review the documentation provided for the design, including specifications and usage instructions.

4. Simulate the design using the provided testbench to verify its functionality:

    ```
    <simulation_command> <testbench_file>
    ```

Replace `<repository_url>`, `<design_name>`, `<simulation_command>`, and `<testbench_file>` with the appropriate values based on your setup.
